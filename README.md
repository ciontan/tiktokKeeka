## TikTok Karma
## Inspiration
We wanted to rethink how TikTok creators get rewarded — not just by views or likes, but by genuine time and attention from their audiences. Witnessing how some viewers might just scroll through content without actually watching it, or as we call it "doom-scrolling", we decided to come up with a method to encourage content creators to create more long form content that can capture the viewer's attention.

## What it does
TikTok Karma distributes a daily pool of coins to creators based on watch time and engagement. Viewers contribute effortlessly, while creators earn fairly through a tiered system.

## How we built it
We designed the logic to track watch time per creator, mapped it to daily coin distribution, and outlined a transparent reward dashboard. Tiers were added to reward consistent, trusted creators.

## Challenges we ran into
Tracking watch time fairly across multiple videos from the same creator
Designing anti-fraud measures to prevent system gaming
Ensuring the flow of coins felt simple and intuitive for viewers

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
A transparent, fair system that rewards genuine engagement
A clear tiered model for recognising long-term trusted creators

## What we learned
Small, simple mechanisms like daily coin pools can make big differences in fairness
Transparency and trust are just as important as performance in reward systems
Building for both creators and viewers requires balancing simplicity with impact

## What's next for TikTok Karma
Expanding tier rewards with perks beyond earnings (e.g., discoverability boosts)
Integrating with TikTok’s existing coin system for a smoother experience
Strengthening fraud detection and fund safety measures
